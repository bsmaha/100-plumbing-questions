        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>A dripping faucet is often caused by a worn-out washer or O-ring in the faucet assembly. Replacing these components can usually stop the drip. Regular maintenance can prevent leaks and extend the faucet's lifespan.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>To prevent frozen pipes during winter, insulate exposed pipes and disconnect garden hoses. Allowing indoor faucets to drip during extreme cold can help prevent freezing. Proper insulation and preventive measures can protect pipes from freezing and potential damage.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>If your toilet is running continuously, it may be due to a faulty flapper valve or a misadjusted float. Check the flapper for proper sealing and adjust the float level to the correct position. If these solutions don't work, consider contacting a plumber for further inspection.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Low water pressure can result from various factors, including sediment buildup in pipes, a partially closed shut-off valve, or a leak in the plumbing system. Inspect the shut-off valve, clean faucet aerators, and address any visible leaks to improve water pressure.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>While chemical drain cleaners can clear minor clogs, they can damage pipes and are harmful to the environment. It's better to use natural methods like baking soda and vinegar, or mechanical solutions like drain snakes, to clear stubborn clogs safely and effectively.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>The frequency of septic tank pumping depends on factors like household size and usage. Generally, septic tanks should be pumped every 3 to 5 years to prevent sludge buildup and maintain proper functioning. Regular pumping helps avoid costly septic system issues.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Gurgling drains can be caused by blocked vents, clogged pipes, or improper drainage. Blocked vents can create pressure imbalances and result in gurgling sounds. If gurgling persists, it's best to consult a plumber to identify and address the underlying issue.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>A slow-draining sink is often caused by a clog in the pipes. You can try using a plunger, a drain snake, or a mixture of baking soda and vinegar to clear the clog. If these methods don't work, consider seeking professional assistance to avoid causing further damage.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>To prevent plumbing leaks, conduct regular inspections of visible pipes and fixtures for signs of moisture or corrosion. Address any leaks promptly and avoid using excessive force when turning faucets or valves. Proper maintenance and quick repairs can help extend the life of your plumbing system.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>The main water shut-off valve is usually located near where the water supply enters your home. It can be in the basement, crawl space, utility room, or near the water meter. Knowing the location of this valve is crucial for quickly stopping the water supply in case of emergencies or repairs.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>A tankless water heater, also known as an on-demand water heater, heats water directly as it flows through the unit. It doesn't store hot water in a tank like traditional water heaters. Tankless heaters offer energy efficiency and provide a continuous supply of hot water, but their installation requirements and costs may differ from conventional heaters.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Flushing your water heater tank annually is recommended to remove sediment buildup. Sediment accumulation can affect the heater's efficiency and performance. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines and turn off the power supply before flushing. Regular maintenance can extend the lifespan of your water heater.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Strange noises from a water heater can be due to sediment buildup, a malfunctioning heating element, or pressure issues. Sediment can cause popping or cracking sounds. If the noise persists, consider contacting a professional plumber to diagnose and address the issue.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>The anode rod is a sacrificial rod made of magnesium or aluminum that is installed inside the water heater tank. It helps prevent corrosion by attracting minerals and sediments that would otherwise corrode the tank. Regularly inspect and replace the anode rod to protect the tank and extend the life of the water heater.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>To improve water heater efficiency, consider insulating hot water pipes, adjusting the thermostat to a reasonable temperature, and installing a timer to regulate operation. Regular maintenance, like flushing the tank and inspecting the anode rod, can also help maintain efficiency and reduce energy consumption.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>While it's possible to install a water heater yourself, it's recommended to hire a professional plumber. Proper installation requires knowledge of local codes, safety precautions, and plumbing connections. Incorrect installation can lead to safety hazards, inefficient operation, and voided warranties.</p>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>If your water heater is leaking, turn off the power supply and water source to the unit. Leaks can be caused by a faulty valve, corroded tank, or pressure issues. Contact a plumber immediately to assess the situation and perform necessary repairs or replacements.</p>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>The lifespan of a water heater varies depending on factors like the type of heater, water quality, and maintenance. Conventional tank water heaters usually last around 10-15 years, while tankless heaters can last 20 years or more with proper care.</p>
