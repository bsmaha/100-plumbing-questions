        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>A dripping faucet is often caused by a worn-out washer or O-ring in the faucet assembly. Replacing these components can usually stop the drip. Regular maintenance can prevent leaks and extend the faucet's lifespan.</p>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>If your toilet is running continuously, it may be due to a faulty flapper valve or a misadjusted float. Check the flapper for proper sealing and adjust the float level to the correct position. If these solutions don't work, consider contacting a plumber for further inspection.</p>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>The frequency of septic tank pumping depends on factors like household size and usage. Generally, septic tanks should be pumped every 3 to 5 years to prevent sludge buildup and maintain proper functioning. Regular pumping helps avoid costly septic system issues.</p>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Gurgling drains can be caused by blocked vents, clogged pipes, or improper drainage. Blocked vents can create pressure imbalances and result in gurgling sounds. If gurgling persists, it's best to consult a plumber to identify and address the underlying issue.</p>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>A slow-draining sink is often caused by a clog in the pipes. You can try using a plunger, a drain snake, or a mixture of baking soda and vinegar to clear the clog. If these methods don't work, consider seeking professional assistance to avoid causing further damage.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>A tankless water heater, also known as an on-demand water heater, heats water directly as it flows through the unit. It doesn't store hot water in a tank like traditional water heaters. Tankless heaters offer energy efficiency and provide a continuous supply of hot water, but their installation requirements and costs may differ from conventional heaters.</p>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Flushing your water heater tank annually is recommended to remove sediment buildup. Sediment accumulation can affect the heater's efficiency and performance. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines and turn off the power supply before flushing. Regular maintenance can extend the lifespan of your water heater.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Strange noises from a water heater can be due to sediment buildup, a malfunctioning heating element, or pressure issues. Sediment can cause popping or cracking sounds. If the noise persists, consider contacting a professional plumber to diagnose and address the issue.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>The anode rod is a sacrificial rod made of magnesium or aluminum that is installed inside the water heater tank. It helps prevent corrosion by attracting minerals and sediments that would otherwise corrode the tank. Regularly inspect and replace the anode rod to protect the tank and extend the life of the water heater.</p>
